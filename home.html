             In the same survey, full-stack developers were found to be the highest-paid type of developer, with an average salary of $71,000 per year.
            
             Full-stack development is a popular career choice, with a large number of developers expressing an interest in becoming full-stack developers. According to the 2021 Stack Overflow survey, 42.1% of respondents identified as full-stack developers.
